This is a command-line utility for controlling and monitoring (via a [Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)) [TP-Link's Kasa Smart Plugs](https://tp-link.com/uk/smarthome).

I test this against my [Kasa KP115](https://www.tp-link.com/uk/home-networking/smart-plug/kp115/).

## üìú Background

I wanted to remote control and monitor the energy usage of a few devices in my house using custom software, so I bought a few of [TP-Link's Kasa Smart Plugs](https://tp-link.com/uk/smarthome) as online reviews mentioned they had an open API which exposed lots of data and did not require linking an online account, both of which turned out to be true.

I originally made this in February of 2022 as my first Go project. However, it was not published here straight away, hence why my [kasa-smart-plug](https://github.com/viral32111/kasa-smart-plug) and [Healthcheck](https://github.com/viral32111/healthcheck) projects were published before this.
